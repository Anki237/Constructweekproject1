## Architecture
Selenium's architecture consists of three main components: the Selenium WebDriver, which provides a programming interface to create and execute test scripts; browser drivers (such as ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver), which act as intermediaries between the WebDriver and the browser to execute commands; and the actual web browsers themselves, which run the commands and perform the actions on the web pages. The WebDriver sends commands to the browser driver using the W3C WebDriver protocol over HTTP, which standardizes the communication and ensures compatibility across different browsers and versions. The browser driver then interacts with the browser to perform the specified actions.
